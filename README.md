## Project Summary
This is a simple quiz game to be played by connected players. The application consşsts of two seperate modules: a server, and a client. The players will be able to enroll in an open quiz game by connecting to the server or connect and wait until ongoing session ends. 

The server will act as a presenter so that it handles incoming connections from players and handle the game. The server asks the questions to the players and keeps the scores during the game. At the end, the server declares a winner and is able to start a new game with new questions and connected players.

The questions are taken from a txt file and asked one by one. The path of the txt file, port number of the server, and the number of questions must be entered before starting a game. Each player must have unique name. For more detailed information.
